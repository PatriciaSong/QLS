,Open-Ended Response.9
17,"i use the library at ALL TIMES OF THE DAY. please make it open as late as possible, thanks. also there need to be a microwave in the library, its late at night and we are hungry, the food spots are closed. also, theres not enough study rooms for groups. i cant study anywhere with my friends. "
20,More grip working spaces please
26,I've arrived on campus before 8 am and was surprised no libraries were 24/7
41,There are limited places for group collaborations
43,I think they are good enough
44,more meeting rooms and collaborative spaces are required
53,The cafe prices are ridiculously high. 8$ for a non dairy coffee. The cafe in the library should be cheaper than competitors like Starbucks or pret. Coffee on campus should be subsidized 
62,"The library is great; however, there are times when there isn't enough space."
65,"There even doesn't has an instruction to tell students where is the library and what's in the library that we can use. Of course we can google, but it's still nice to have some instructions on website or townhall events since it's very effective. "
70,"No library guidance before the term. (like the use of VPN, searching, etc. As far as I know, a lot of students don't even know the electronic library)"
71,"Longer library hours, free coffee and more discussion spaces must be encouraged. "
74,The outlets of S&E library are badly designed. I cannot plug the charger of my laptop in it.
77,Can you build more power outlets on the first floor? And can you improve the power outlets on the second floor? Current ones are difficult to plug in for some adapters
78,It would be good if the hours of operation could be increased for some of the libraries other than Butler.
90,It is disappointing that many of the libraries on campus do not have a color printer. The printers are also very limited in paper size and does not-offer a3 sizes
92,I think it might be better for Engineering Library to extend some hours at late night
93,"Online access to scientific journals is difficult to find and use. Switching to something accessible from the website of the journal itself rather than through the CU library website, or at least making the access easy to find, would be most helpful. "
95,I think it is bullshit that stem students don't have access to all libraries. We are all paying the same amount of tuition for different access to resources. LET STEM STUDENTS INTO ALL LIBRARIES. 
152,Libraries should be 24/7
164,"I find library access extremely useful. Because I have an office in NWC, I don't frequently visit the library to use it as a study space. "
183,"I’ve been here 4 years and I am still unaware of the available study spaces or libraries, there should be information on best spots to study sit or have coffee , or an easier way to see when cafes are open. Nothing on campus seems easy to find or accessible."
220,Keep libraries open 24/7 or at least very late at night
229,More white boards available for thinking 
232,maybe have more quite rooms for study
256,"There aren’t a lot of spots. Printers are hard if not impossible to print in color, which is sometimes important in engineering"
272,There are not enough seats on Mudd 4th floor sometimes.
301,"The book ""Ace the Data Science Interview"" code be a good addition to your collection. 5 or 10 copies could be useful to serve every dpt that forms data scientists"
346,-
358,need to be able to book more seats in libraries
371,"More study rooms, please! I always just go to Uris."
377,Open Mudd LATERRR!!!!
381,"I used library resources much more extensively during my Master's program, when I did not have a desk of my own. I found them excellent, but crowded (it is always hard to find a desk in popular spots like Butler or NWC)."
383,More space for collaboration. Often times the collaboration space is filled and it is insufficient for the number of students 
388,an upgrade on vending machines or coffee machines could be nice
390,"I work, so these would be best used in the evening"
391,"Columbia e-resource is kind of poor. For many times I am not able to obtain the books (usually in mathematics) online through our library, while my friends at her university (CMU) can. So I have to find other sources."
403,Need a larger printer quota
411,naybe can have a sleeping room
413,"To provide more group study rooms, and to fix the electricity in the study room so that people can charge their computers"
419,Need open spaces for students to work  Libraries are always full so we need space to work as group  Perhaps using open classrooms
436,Printing should be free!
456,There needs to be more printers around campus the current printers are often broken and hard to find. 
478,Still many students talk loudly in the area that should be quiet.
495,People would love it if the library is open during the summer until late in the evening and early in the morning. Maybe 8 AM to 10 PM could be one optimal option.
534,"I work at the medical campus, so it would be nice to have access to libraries there."
557,m
558,More outlets 
572,It would be nice if the library hours on Friday and Saturday could be extended.
585,"It should be open 24*7 if possible. I love the SEAS library ambience, however, feel that it closes too soon. As a result, I have to shift to Butler to continue studying which is always dim lit :("
598,More private group study rooms 
601,Temperature control
605,Open overnight
606,I personally just wanted to comment that it's been good that the remaining covid restrictions have finally been lifted and libraries can be utilized more comfortably. 
609,"The process of booking the study rooms could be improved - for now we can book a maximum of 2 hours a day, but they have to be contiguous which makes it difficult. It would be nice to be able to break up that time interval."
613,Hopefully the library has a late closing time on Friday and Saturday.
621,"I have never been to any library on campus, and do not know where any libraries other than Bulter Library are located. Otherwise, I would be likely to use library individual and group study spaces."
626,Please announce a revised schedule for a spring or fall break in advance via school email
630,more printer！
640,provide more group study rooms in the libraries
674,Timings should be as late as possible. Washrooms and water dispensers could be better placed (In the science and engineering library)
724,More collaborative work space
754,No
756,More group study spaces and computers that have relevant software installed. Its good having it in the lab but I usually don't use the library because I need the computers in the lab that have software such as SAP2000
757,"Other than the science and engineering library, the libraries at this school are extremely outdated and not comparable to other universities of the caliber that Columbia claims to have."
769,"Students should be provided with a greater number of free print credits as some of the students have more case-based classes. For group studies, the Uris library rooms are very useful, and hence the hours of operation should be increased. If required, a pilot can be run to see the footfall and, based on this, a further decision may be taken. Students taking classes at the MHVL campus should be allowed to book meeting rooms in those buildings, which is currently prohibited."
770,Its helpful to increase the timeslot of booking group study rooms to 3 hrs
771,The libraries are as good as it is. Butler is always hot tho
788,No comments
845,I want more libraries to open in late night and have cafes open 
849,"Maybe you can provide more group study rooms. In addition, a more important thing is the printing quota for a graduate student. I found it is totally not sufficient when I only have $2 per week to print something. It would be extremely helpful if we can have the same semester-based quota level as an undergraduate student."
858,"The wifi on campus and in the libraries is terrible, and printers are extremely low resolution, and colors don't work on half of them. "
860,It would be better if there are some screen monitors that can connect to our own laptops in Science and Engineering Library.
862,More study spaces 
868,PLEASE MAKE THE COLOUR PRINTERS ON THE CAMPUS FUNCTIONAL!
880,It’s ridiculous that our printing is capped to $2.50 per week. I can’t even print a single 10 page research paper with that quota. SEAS/CC undergrad printing quota were so much better!
889,DNE
909,More study rooms for group project discussion will be useful
911,Computers with engineering softwares (matlab) or resources to find where to find them 
926,More group study areas would be nice
932,"The libraries close quite early, and the staff are often quite rude."
944,"I haven't been to the libraries much, but group or individual study rooms that you can book in advance would be great"
954,have printers available in Mudd for student use
964,Please note that my above answers represent behavior during the ongoing pandemic. 
970,-
1020,Keep a few cafes open till late in the evening.
1022,need more group study rooms
1032,"NWC library closes too early everyday. I hope it could open until 9, or at least 6"
1045,Please allow friends/family in libraries as they want to see it too just once.
1047,"Please make google scholar access easier when you are off campus wifi. It is a pain to try to access academic papers when not on the network. Even when I VPN into the network, there are more steps to go through and sometimes the article isn't available for whatever reason."
1050,COMS4232 is completely trash. They hired a TA who cant even understand basic maths.
1064,"I don’t use physical libraries, but I frequently make use of academic journal access"
1068,Power plugs are difficult to find in the Engineering Library! Most tables don't have any and it's been a problem a lot of times.
1069,Having late hours at the Science and Engineering library start a few weeks before the official midterm point of the season since most SEAS classes have multiple midterms per semester and have their first midterms weeks before the library extends its hours. 
1073,"I would like to have access to the Law School again. It was my favorite study spot pre-COVID, and now I don't have access for the building. It was nice and relaxing to sit and study there, and it is weird to be denied entry now."
1087,Generally the spaces all feel a bit crowded. I would appreciate being able to see capacity status.  I would really appreciate efficient and clear ways to book study rooms for a small group of people.
1093,It is good enough for me.
1112,More monitors/computers please
1121,"It would be great, to even download there specific programs that are not on the computer yet, without approval from the administration."
1124,"Carpets and tables need cleaning, defective chairs need to be replaced"
1130,"The wifi coverage in Lehman Library is terrible, especially on the lower level. Please do something about it. "
1131,MSBA students are not able to book private study rooms in either the Uris Business & Economics Library or in any of the study rooms in Kravis or Geffen at the new CBS campus. This makes group work especially frustrating and difficult to coordinate. I feel like this program is akin to a child of divorce between the Business & Engineering school.
1140,It would be nice if libraries opened at like 7 or 8 am 
1147,Too few group study options.
1155,"During midterm and final week, it is hard to find a space"
1170,"The study rooms need to be equipped with the proper cables for connecting laptops to the TV, and a short laminated manual. "
1176,It will be better that library have space open 24 hours.
1191,I love the booths at the science and engineering library but there are only a few :(
1201,"The libraries are very busy, and not very well monitored for noisy students. I found that I work far better in the library, but there were groups of students that essentially 'chased' me out because they would start chatting to each other every 5 minutes (there was almost guaranteed to be a group of students making noise every time I went to the libraries). There are also few spaces that have a smaller occupancy number, so there is a constant flow of people (ie the large rooms have people coming and going constantly, and there appears to be no smaller rooms that would prevent the feeling of foot traffic)."
1210,NO
1211,There should be more printers and color ones. Also there should be some places where we can eat. 
1235,wish the libraries opened earlier (7 or 8 rather than 9)
1260,"Please make the library open more early in the morning, 9am is too late when sometimes we have classes at 8.40 and we cannot stay at home to take them."
1261,an indication of how crowded the libraries are on the website would be useful
1289,Please repair the A/C heating systems of indoor personal rooms of Uris Hall library. They are ancient and do not work!
1304,this library is constantly packed!
1315,"Please increase the late-night operational hours of library (if possible, make 24/7) "
1324,"The engineering library does not have sufficient printing capabilities and would ideally have a color printer. Additionally, there aren't really good places for group study as the booths are often taken by single students studying. The screens for projecting at these booths are also outdated."
1333,more printing devices and drinks
1348,"If the library begins to open all day or have longer hours to stay, that would be better."
1354,Color printer in Noco
1359,More seating at the engineering library 
1360,Libraries are perfect and I really like it
1361,Lack of group study space in basically all libraries
1369,"I think for textbooks, one copy (from all the libraries) should be available (besides the one on reserve) for students to borrow."
1376,"Not enough space for so many students, and it’s a bit noisy"
1378,"Have more libraries with late hours, more group study areas (similar to SIPA library)"
1403,"Just like Butler library, would love to access Science and Engineering library 24*7."
1432,It would be nice to have more library spaces that allow for discussion.
1450,Have not yet been
1452,More printing dollars! $2/week is ridiculous especially during midterms and finals season. Columbia undergraduates have a semesterly quota instead which seems to be more appropriate
1507,Can we get more weekly printing cash? $2 is not enough on the weeks I have to print
1517,I think libraries are perfect in CU
1528,"One main suggestion is to allow better seating, extension of laptop screens to the monitors present in the library."
1538,More libraries should be close later in the day. Preferably midnight
1558,Make the libraries (at least Engineering library) open for 24 hours. Have vending machines in/close to all libraries (like they are in Watson library).
