9,"Should NOT be required for MS, especially for the ones that want to pursue a PhD degree after the MS program."
17,"i dont like the guest speakers that they bring in. i like the resume and interview ones, that was all. "
24,PDL was great!
26,PDL core accomplished a base line.  It would have been nicer to have received more targeted resume and cover letter feedback in a more timely manner. I remember submitting them before classes began and receiving feedback a month plus afterwards.  
43,"The best part is resume composing and we can use VMock to polish our resume, which is a very good website. Also, the toolbox for work persuing from Raina is super useful."
70,"Being scheduled to take courses that I am not interested in at all. Very, very disappointed."
74,The core modules are wonderful. But the elective modules are not at the same level.
78,It's a very good program if someone wants to focus on their overall knowledge as well as personality development.
80,Master student should have handshake access. It's absurd not offering student baisc career service platform. The current Vmock platform is not adquete and its mobile application is not functional.
83,I think it would be better if we can have less PDL requirements.
88,"One of the (few) really well structured programs - shout-out to Gaby, Jenny & team."
89,I WANT THE SLIDES AND RECORDINGS!!!!!
110,I wish there had been more variety in the electives available. 
149,The offer of both in person and on zoom classes has really been beneficial. It allowed me to follow more PDL classes even if I could not attend in person.
153,You are asking way too much with the PDL and taking it way too seriously
181,The teaching varies a lot - the core requirements were sometimes painful because we couldn't choose our teachers (Chuck Garcia was awful) but the electives are better because you can be more selective. I wish the elective schedule stated more consistently who was teaching what. 
186,"The topics are too general and the lectuers do not provide knowledge of actual use to master's level students. They might be a fit for undergrads, but master's need more concrete and applicable PDL support. The basics of professional development is not enough."
220,I found PDL to be too generic and advice was usually commonplace and general knowledge. Try connecting students with alumni and individually tailoring courses based on student preferences.
226,Good stuff
232,better to have more technical electives
305,waste of time
335,Best part of IEOR
357,Maybe the PDL team can hold some in person activities to help students know each other better.
359,Satisfied
369,"PDL has been a completely useless and unhelpful requirement. Vmock is terrible and arguably required me to make my resume worse or lie in order to reach the required 86 score (which I just changed back after achieving that score). The formatting and assistant functions when used substantially dropped my score and I had to waste another submission reuploading an old file just to edit off of to fix it. The suggests are ridiculous and often times just bad, it tailored to a terribly outdated cookie cutter design of requirements like requiring a “skills” tab or you automatically lose 10 points. I actually added just a blank skills subsection to get the points because for my field that’s something that would look absurd wasting space on an application. In general the rest of the curriculum just seems like a straight waste of time. The core 5 weren’t terrible (except for the VMock service and making a pointless video recording of yourself with the cheesy “why did you pick Columbia!?” The elective requirement on the other hand is absolutely absurd and everyone I know signed up to just put to the side while they actually did productive things. Some of them are useful topics for those who want to do them but making them a graduation requirement (only for MS students by the way) is absurd."
371,"You should definitely consider adding an elective to talk about the responsibility of scientists, not just in the Ethics sense, but to specifically address threats to humanity (climate change, AI risk, pandemic risk and nuclear conflict)."
377,No more Chuck Garcia. 
379,relatively useless
380,Maybwe find a more efficient way to record the attendance of students instead of sending emails to directors to report the attendance of students 
382,"Overall, i feel like the intent of pdl courses are great to gear students to build up their professional resume and advance in career placement rather than just studying for exams. "
388,It is not helpful and imposing. 
393,The materials of interview electives should be deeper
411,I enjoy these courses
420,"PDL has added a lot of stress to my life, and the offerings are just not relevant to me given my interests and career goals. I feel that the program should be optional - I'm sure it's a great program for some, but may not be right for everyone. For instance, some students may have had work experience in the past, or may be more interested in pursuing academia, etc."
425,10 seems excessive and they are not well described prior to attending
429,PDL is awesome!!!! 
438,#NAME?
456,I do not think it is meaningful for me but I had a similar program during undergrad. 
457,The PDL Program is good but could use some more additional electives. 
465,not so useful
479,"I think it might be helpful to make them more technical and specific to a major, rather than generic interviewing advice. The sessions were way too broad and general, to be of any help. "
491,"I think it is a very good idea, and I think it should be mandatory. I do think that the quality varies dramatically, though. Some modules have very helpful information, and others I think I could easily come up with (without any experience) if given a couple of hours to build a slide deck."
499,I like having the option of choosing which elective course I can take. I chose course I was interested in and overall was very happy with my choices.
503,Some PDL program should be more technical since the course name seems techinical but the content not
519,Some materials content appeared to be unstructured and overlapping a lot between courses taught by the same instructor.
531,The core sessions should have more sessions later in the semester as well. I arrived late at Columbia due to late visa approval and ended up missing a few core sessions.
557,Would be more effective if it was in person
571,The PDL modules have been extremely helpful for professional development - it's helped me develop a professional online image.
572,Had an overall good experience.
589,bit high level/common sense
603,I like the life management and technical offerings
606,It would be nice to have a wider variety and more availability of the more niche PDL sessions that are advertised on the PDL website
639,Good
653,-
660,"Most of the PDL sessions were good some ok and some not great, but TBH i have too much work experience for them to matter too much."
683,"the content was not at all useful , could have provided better courses"
685,Seems to be tailored towards international students and people that do not know how to interact with employers. Not useful for domestic students.
745,"The PDL times are often inconvenient. Only having them on Monday Wednesdays and Fridays limits my ability to attend because I only have free time really on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I haven't seen classes posted for those days, especially early in the semester."
754,no
756,I feel that I would have gotten much more out of PDL had it been in person
769,"The PDL team should work more closely with students and help them develop their resumes and cover letters and provide support to create multiple versions of them. Currently, one type of document is allowed to be submitted as the HW of the assignment after the core PDL session, and not very detailed constructive feedback is shared. The students come from very different geographic backgrounds, and in some parts of the world, resumes and CVs are two or more pages. The PDL team working with students closely (like in 1-1 sessions) would help students develop more effective resumes and cover letters and make them ready to apply for internships very early in the program. (This is especially useful for students who want to apply for consulting positions because the deadlines are so early.)"
770,PDL as an addendum to the course structure helps in the overall professional conduct which is an essential skill to have in addition to technical skills.
771,PDL is really informative and useful. 
776,It is amazing!
788,Good elective options
833,One of the reasons I chose to go to Columbia.
842,"Some information is repetitive in some core and elective courses and the assessment of assignments is never shared with students, so students are unable to improve through feedback"
845,I love PDL sessions
858,"PDL was great, and gave me hope for Columbia's care for students before I got here. "
859,Felt like a waste of time. Did not get much out of it
860,I love tech interview prep classes. 
875,Too many PDLs aimed at CS students and not traditional engineering 
878,.
925,"There should be far fewer requirements for the PDL program. Each session is nearly 2 hours long, and there are many required courses. By cutting the number of classes required in half, students will participate more meaningfully in the courses they take."
946,"PDL should be a ""bonus"" to my degree, and therefore be offered after all my classes or during times that do not interfere with the rest of my classes or office hours. I really do not understand why PDL sessions are not offered at NIGHT. 7pm and later all students are available. So far all PDL sessions have been exclusively offered during times when I have class. Then I get condescending emails from the PDL team to ""make sure to mark my calendar"" so I don't miss a session. Marking my calendar was never the problem. These sessions should be offered at night so they are available to all students. Especially if you make them required and they are 2 hours long! But also, some of these sessions cater to certain students than others. I should not have to go to a consulting PDL session, potentially taking someone else's spot, because I feel that this is the only one that works with my schedule and I need to fill a quota, rather than going because I am genuinely interested and want to pursue consulting. This has happened to me for a rare interviewing PDL session I wanted to attend, but instead people who just wanted to get their credits filled took most of the spots. If this program is truly supplementing our professional development, then it should be catered to the students not the PDL staff. Make PDL sessions catered to specific departments that work around the classes offered by that department. Or, again, offer them in the evenings. "
954,Would be much better if the sessions were shorter and would allow for more participation. 
970,-
984,"The PDL program really needs a boost. With online career prep on YouTube, the content produced by PDL doesn't even come close in quality. Mock interviews should be more assessible. Some of the topics offered by PDL are copies of other courses (e.g. Chuck Garcia's How to Win Friends and Influence People course was identical to his emotional intelligence course.) No walk in center for career questions, everything is by email with vague, hand wavy like answers. Coming from a state school, I expected Columbia to be much better with career prep and I had high hopes since we had to start the summer before we arrived, but ultimately the program does not prepare students for careers and much better content can be found online (in fact Chuck Garcia played a YouTube video in his course - not sure if that is ethical considering he is paid and uses someone else's content).   "
1001,The PDL sessions were conducted regularly and were highly informative
1015,"I find it cumbersome that it is required, not optional."
1020,-
1027,Interesting topics and helpful to have slides after. Taking more sessions but each one is shorter could be interesting because we could learn more variety of topics and it would fit in schedules easier.
1028,"PDL was one of the most helpful courses I took in the program, as many of us likely had little experience or prior guidance on these topics to the extent that these courses covered."
1045,The lecturers in PDL sessions are very enthusiastic and interactive which makes these sessions really good.
1050,COMS4232 is completely trash. They hired a TA who cant even understand basic maths.
1058,Excellent 
1072,"At first I was very adamant about PDL courses, but honestly, they have been super flexible in offering a huge diversity of courses and specially a huge flexibility in their availability. They have been at various hours of the day, online and in person. As a full time employee, this has been extremely appreciated. It also hasn't been only one class offered late. There have been many options and every time I attend one, I learn a lot and have a great time! It's been a very pleasant experience with PDL."
1086,The PDL program has been educational and helpful.
1087,"As a professional with several years of experience, many of the contents were less relevant for me. However, I appreciate having an advisor who is helpful about providing resources."
1093,It is helpful
1096,Very well organized course content
1100,I found PDL to have some interesting topics but overall it was quiet superficial
1110,"Assignments shouldnt have deadlines since they didnt give acces to Vmock, etc at the begining of the semester (when I actually have time to do the tasks)"
1121,It would be great if some topics would be go over several lectures instead of just one.
1133,"PDL is designed primarily with international students in mind. It should be an elective for everyone else. The only useful session was Resume, everything else was of questionable quality. Sessions by Chuck Garcia and Fred Garcia were basically used to advertise their books. Same goes for the ""advanced"" SQL elective -- I immediately started receiving spam from Cockroach DB after attending."
1141,I think the PDL team/modules are one of the best things of the program.
1146,I found the modules to be quite useful
1147,Most modules are too easy and conveyed information are basic understanding.
1155,Some class is kind of boring but some are very useful
1160,It's great to have PDL program but the school should also have enough experienced career advisors to talk to students 1v1 to help us with our resumes and mock interviews...
1171,Very helpful for career development 
1201,"They were the kind of boring and probably, in the long run, not that useful."
1210,Great
1211,10 modules are too much. I think there should be 3 before the school starts and 3 during the school 
1228,"Good program, but sometimes have sessions that are unnecessary. "
1254,It is an inconvenient requirement that only adds to the pressure put on by graduate classes. I however did find VMock to be very useful for improving my resume.
1265,I prefer the electives over the core modules and find them more useful
1278,"Overall very well executed, but a lot of sessions required. "
1285,Vmock has weird resume and linkedin advice sometimes
1304,"Programs should allow until end of graduate school to complete. There are several classes (2hrs each), huge time commitment once school begins. OR allow taking classes over breaks (summer/December/Spring)"
1307,I hope more professional people from different industries could come and introduce their career and experience.
1308,I enjoyed every second of it.
1315,"Its a good to have program, but I feel the time alloted for the topics are too short. Like a 2 hour elective to learn deep technical topics like database or git/bash are too short. It won't have any impact on the individual practically apart from just knowing that this thing exists. It would be better to curate some hands on training material and have an overview for it, instead of just going over the fundamental definitions during the elective sessions."
1333,pdl could be more interesting
1338,It was very helpful to do this the first semester as a Columbia student and I strongly recommend all students to do it as soon as they become part of the Columbia community. 
1351,PDL sessions were really great 
1354,I felt like they were mainly targeted toward international students which I am not
1358,The time electives are offered are very inconvenient. I always have classes when I need to fulfill certain PDL elective requirement
1360,Each session is perfect and I can learn a lot in it.
1369,"Good overall, while more industrial-specific workshops would make PDL better"
1378,"Needs more in-person classes. Also, need to develop more classes that demand interaction."
1395,Should’ve been through CVN doing it over the summer was a nightmare since it started at 9am east coast time and I was in california 6am
1403,Great team with excellent content! Enjoyed every minute of the PDL sessions.
1405,Seems unnecessary for people who have significant work experience prior to enrollment. 
1410,There could have been seminars related to career planning
1413,Good Sessions
1427,offer times on other days than Monday and Wednesday
1465,It's pretty good. One of few positive things that have to do with staff rather than faculty
1482,It was pretty informative 
1501,I just wish the elective modules were held more throughout the week rather than mainly on Friday’s. 
1506,"not tailored to my industry, too general that I find similar things at google. We can at least create opportunities to let students have similar career goals get together,which I did by my personal connection. I am so disappointed about ieor career service, very unhappy."
1507,"The variety of when courses are offered need to be better. More often than not electives would be in the afternoon on teh same days I had classes, made it difficult to schedule in PDL that I actually enjoyed."
1528,I love the PDL program. Would’ve been much better if it had been in-person for my cohort.
1552,"PDL seems more essential for those not having worked in the US before, so the information was redundant for me"
1564,"This program (especially the Core Modules over the summer) seems VERY geared towards international students and students who have never had jobs in the field before. The sessions over the summer were pretty useless to me. I was in the process of quitting my job and getting ready to go back to school when I was told I needed to update my resume and linkedin and pick a bunch of companies I wanted to work for, as well as practice my English. These sessions were not geared towards me at all, and I was actually wondering if I had made a mistake in choosing Columbia because of them. These sessions should be optional."
1572,One of the best resources offered to students at Columbia!
