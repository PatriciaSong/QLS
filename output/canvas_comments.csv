0,6,Email notifications are usually a bit late but overall it's still good
1,17,please provide a way to contact people from my class
2,26,"2 out of 8 of my classes used any collaboration with students, TAs, and Professors in forum format (e.g., ask a question receive an answer)"
3,43,"On my phone, I always get the same annoucement 2 times on canvas and one time from email. And when prof adding annotations on submitted assignments, we will get annoucements contimuously."
4,45,The inbox is great. 
5,47,You may add the features like gradescope.
6,62,The announcement section on the web does not always work.
7,70,Why Echo 360 so hard to use?
8,72,"Make it more uniform for all courses. Some professors use canvas, some don't and ask us to refer to their personal website. "
9,78,It would be good to have some more features integrated with it. 
10,88,"Really hard to track previous semester courses. For example, I have no idea which PDL from which semester is my active one - some electives go up in an old one."
11,90,"The naming format is not consistent, as some professors list by course code (COMS 4732) while others list by course name (Computer Vision). I would prefer if all are listed by name. Also, while I appreciate having access to previous courses, it should be in a different section and I have too many courses listed currently. "
12,93,Gradescope is wonderful and Canvas-integrated. It's use should be encouraged in all classes.
13,152,Instructors don't really know how to take full advantage of Canvas. Perhaps more dedicated staff for Canvas support would be helpful with setting up each course.
14,157,"As a TA, I find courseworks limited when I try to upload individualized comment files for each student (generated by a grading script). I either have to upload each file individually or type the comments manually, neither of which is convenient. "
15,161,It’s better if there shown time and location of each course in canvas
16,211,Hoping if the videos can be downloaded so I can watch while offline as well. And I hope all video qualities are good. Like my classroom for blockchain this semester was so nice and the quality of the video and sound was good. Meanwhile the video quality for ELEN E6945 is so bad and one of the video got muted too. Hope this can improve! Thank you! 
17,226,It's better to close function such as big blue button by default so it won't show up even though it is never opened for use
18,232,it's better to involve more interactions between students and TAs
19,249,Some courses have poor Canvas layout
20,254,the duo authentication needs to be open at least for few hours
21,358,"It is a hassle to keep switching in grade scope, canvas etc"
22,373,you can see assignment statistics on mobile but not on desktop for some reason
23,377,I <3 Canvas.
24,388,DUO is very hard to use with a lot of login errors and compatibility issues
25,390,Mobile app needs to be better
26,410,provide subtitle
27,411,"When updating submissions, do not overwrite previous submissions"
28,425,Stop using DUO
29,436,There is some ambiguity as to whether announcements go in Ed or on Courseworks.
30,438,"- There are issues with multiple (duplicate) notifications on canvas    - You cannot check the notifications on desktop website    - As a Course Assistant, I am unable to guide through a mobile app or the website if there is a comment made on a submission, however, while using the same application on an iPad it works just fine    - Collaboration and making groups is very confusing, and a lot of my classmates find trouble understanding it    - Chat window is an amazing feature, however, again due to notifications and navigating through the application is very difficult    - The pressing issue if notifications, I get almost 10 notifications for the same thing, which is very irritating"
31,465,good app
32,499,Overall I like Canvas. I find it easy to use and I have never had difficulty finding my course material or submitting assignments on it.
33,503,Hope all courses have video library to review the class
34,509,Very good
35,510,It is very easy to use and manage all the coursework content in one place.
36,520,Free courses online such a MOOCS have better tech
37,521,"Popularize the use of the ""Rubrics"" feature of Canvas among graders/TAs, which allows for easier grading and detailed student feedback. Or alternatively, the use of ""Gradescope"" integration."
38,546,"Having to enter 2FA every 48 hours is too excessive.  It is ironic that SSOL, which contains personally identifiable information, does not even require 2FA, meanwhile Canvas does."
39,571,"The Canvas app is extremely helpful to easily check on classes, assignments, and announcements"
40,598,Deadline management
41,601,Having a mobile app is super convenient. I don’t understand why we need gradescope too
42,631,Very positive experience
43,685,Canvas is only manageable if the instructors put effort in setting it up
44,744,Good utility but interface can be improved
45,754,no
46,756,Canvas is a great tool. I Wish more professors used the calendar function of it to show assignments and exams however.
47,758,No comments in particular regarding Canvas. 
48,769,"Once the announcement or notifications have been seen, they disappear, but it'd be great if they remained in the notification tab so that I could access the past announcements later in time."
49,770,Canvas is super easy and handy with everything regarding the course all at one place
50,771,Canvas is really helpful
51,788,No additional comments
52,790,Multiple file submission would make student's life easier.
53,814,Have all professors use Ed. it is much more modern and if everything is in one place its easier to track
54,825,not enough meeting room
55,842,"The mobile website doesn't show features like 'Groups', and one has to login to laptop to access that info. "
56,845,I love the canvas application 
57,889,DNE
58,909,No
59,921,Let us download lecture videos 
60,932,"Terrible integration with Ed discussion. I have no idea whether an Ed account was created for me; I always get emails to open threads but then I have to log in, but the only way I know how to log in is by going through Canvas. The Canvas mobile optimization is also terrible.  I also had no idea there was a chat function, and I don't know what it would be used for."
61,953,I only disagree with course announcements as I often dont check canvas frequently enough to get some of them (for example in the case of a class cancelation) 
62,954,need to make sure all teachers keep canvas consistent with what they say and syllabus as there is often contradiction and it is unclear what to trust. 
63,964,Most of my undergraduate lectures were filmed by default and available for easy review later via a Canvas-like site. Why is this not the case at Columbia?
64,970,-
65,982,Would be great if courses from the previous semester were hidden so that i can find my courses easier
66,1020,-
67,1045,"Canvas sometimes logs itself out on my phone which is annoying, other than that, its really good."
68,1047,It takes too long to load even the most basic functions like clicking on which class page to visit.
69,1050,COMS4232 is completely trash. They hired a TA who cant even understand basic maths.
70,1068,It looks like software from the 90's.
71,1069,"For canvas announcements, I think a helpful feature to keep on top of course material and also make it easier to find specific announcements related to a course would be to add a feature where email notifications for each announcement can be received and include somewhere in subject or email body the course number and name and the professor's name (so that searches in the email inbox with either will surface the announcement email). Also when new files are uploaded or changed, I think having a notification that can be opted-into when a professor added or changes files for a course would be helpful (usually a prof. will mention the change in class but this would be helpful when out sick to know new files are available that need to be checked out. "
72,1083,"Sometimes an assignment can be difficult to see, also I would hope the system can send out reminders before the deadlines"
73,1093,It is good enough for me
74,1096,"It a very good platform to maintain course files, grading content, exams, etc."
75,1100,I wish everyone used the same tools
76,1108,mobile app notifications could have been better
77,1126,More professors should use canvas to submit assignments instead of submitting in person
78,1147,Not used as only tool by most professors...  SpeedGrader is not intuitive and some functionalities are tiresome to use.
79,1155,it’s great to be able to personalized the display of classes
80,1159,crucial organizational tool
81,1166,N/a
82,1173,"I believe that piazza should be dropped altogether in favor of Ed. Courses that still utilize piazza have higher response times and lower quality interactions from my experience. However, I suppose piazza is free. "
83,1186,I find the Duo authentication very bothersome
84,1201,"I think the 'courses' tabs that pops up would be nicer if it could be organised differently (eg selecting semester the course fell under, or being able to organise it ourselves). It's currently ordered the alphabetically, but the courses are named by 'random' letters and numbers (eg if I am looking for Theory of Electrons I have to sift through a whole bunch of MSAE_1234's first). "
85,1210,Duo makes Canvas painful
86,1211,Announcements do not come to my email.  
87,1213,nope
88,1228,Very good plataform. 
89,1232,"I wish there was a way to bulk mark announcements as read, because usually I read them from my email but then still have a little notification icon on Canvas for the announcement and I have to manually click all of them to mark as read. Not sure if that's something you can change though. "
90,1285,I think canvas is good
91,1287,"Canvas is fine, I think it's convenient but only as good as the instructor sets it up to be."
92,1315,"1. It would be convenient to have a common dashboard for course announcements like an Inbox, since there are so many courses, it's hard to keep track of new announcements by checking each course page announcement tab. I don't know if it's already present, I don't know about it.  2. It would be great if an option to view the lectures offline is provided, it would be easy for people on commute or vacation to view lectures. Can keep some threshold to keep the access limited like 2-3 lectures at a time only."
93,1333,it is good to use
94,1339,Canvas jumps back to home page everytime I leave the app (on phone). It'll be good if we can stay at the last page we are at in case we are switching between apps or want to remember the last page we are on.
95,1347,Too many tabs on the side and 80% of them aren't relevant.
96,1351,There's some courses that doesn't offer video lectures recording. If it'll be available that can be more useful for students.
97,1360,Canvas is a great web service and easy to use. 
98,1361,"Piazza was better than Ed. Some professors have a very messy Canvas, which can be confusing."
99,1365,Canvas is good enough for me to get study materials.
100,1369,It would be helpful if all the assignments (HWs and exams) are graded on Canvas (instead of any other places such as Gradescope).
101,1376,"Some class doesn’t include syllabus on Canvas, but it should."
102,1378,Needs improvement to the video player. It crashes whenever I quickly jump timestamps
103,1427,"Let's stick to Canvas and not use separate websites for each course. Also there shouldn't be any files on google drives. All info on a course should be in ""Course Info"" or ""Syllabus"""
104,1433,"I am really not a fan of the layout. The D2L layout for university portals is superior in my opinion and far more intuitive. Also, Duo Authenticate does not make sense on my phone, which is my authentication method - it makes opening emails about announcements and files on Canvas nearly impossible to interact with!"
105,1457,/
106,1495,There could be more uniformity. Teachers often use Canvas in various ways.
107,1507,"I wish the grades feature provided more about class performance instead of just min, max and mean"
108,1511,Canvas keeps sending repeated notifications which is annoying
109,1517,i do not have any. 
110,1528,"Canvas, while on hand is really intuitive, has its way of portraying legacy technology based applications which might be counterproductive."
111,1532,"I don't use Chat at all.  I don't like Ed as much as I liked Piazza.  The assignment and video library are good features, but Canvas overall feels slow."
112,1549,its not great but really doesn't matter
