0,6,It would be nice to not have strict registration windows.
1,17,why are there two websites? remove virgil and just make SSOL the only website tat has to do with finding classes for registration. its too much work. 
2,26,Neither agree nor disagree is I have not used it.  Course registration the first time around was confusing.  Maybe I missed a video that exists but it would have been helpful before time to have a screen by screen view of registering. I added a class to my wish list first time around but didn't realize that wasn't registering for a course.
3,39,Cannot submit the graduation application form directly on SSOL.
4,43,"The time to get paper edition transcript takes too long, and for international students, if we will go back to our homeland and also want a complete transcript after graduation, it would be low success with delivery to other countries."
5,47,The feature of Keyword Search should be more powerful.
6,65,It's so wired you don't have any instructions for new students  to show how to register courses at SSOL. The whole page would be shown until it's the time to register. It's super un user-friendly. 
7,72,If there was a way to know the waitlist to final procedure more transparently that would be great.
8,78,It would be good to have course descriptions and some more material added to the Vergil to help us make an informed choice while selecting courses. That's a little inadequate right now.
9,92,SSOL cannot tell the position of the waitlist sometimes and shows 'Instructor Managed'. This is VERY unhelpful because it offers no clue the chance student might get into the class and waste the waitlist position.
10,93,"Why is SSOL not protected with two factor authentication? I must go through the whole rigamaroll to look at library books online, but not to access financial or personal details."
11,111,IT'S SUCH AN UGLY WEBSITE!!! This is not the 2000s anymore we have JavaScript now
12,113,add a feature to add schedule to calendar
13,128,should be more user friendly
14,132,I found that the shopping period was virtually useless because by that time all the courses I wanted to switch to had a long waitlist and I couldn't get in. 
15,136,Haven't used many of these features yet
16,207,It would be nice if classes were shown in a calendar format in ssol as well
17,220,Registration could severely be improved with respect to more senior students gaining priority registration and incorporating such changes that enable a seamless registration process.
18,226,The degree audit is always returning error for me
19,232,it's better to integrate Vergil and ssol into one platform
20,234,"it might be helpful to more frequently inform me about the billing DDLs via Email, SMS, etc."
21,249,Students should be able to export their course schedules to Google Calendar
22,254,Why doesn't ssol have duo authentication ????
23,258,"Course registration should take lottery, not FCFS"
24,301,#NAME?
25,357,Transcript
26,359,Satisfied
27,377,SSOL is outdated.
28,388,Registration for the desired and required courses is frustrating. Many of the international students need to mentally prepare for deportation during the pandemic. 
29,391,Registration time is not continuous but can only be done on some certain weekday daytime. Why students cannot register at any time during the registration period?
30,392,The waitlist is so strange. I was on the 1st position waitlist for one class and there are many people dropping the course. But finally I didn't get in the class.
31,410,I think the course registration could provide a Reference for students in the same department to select courses  
32,411,pretty nice
33,416,I live in Columbia housing and paying rent is a nightmare. The EBill both charges and credits me for my stipend pay and it is mixed with the charges for my rent. There are three different locations where I can see what I owe and all of them are different numbers. I am a fully funded PhD student who does not pay for classes so my rent payments should be separate and organized from how they currently mixed with my course payments and their book keeping.
34,419,Course registration can be greatly improved
35,420,"Too many systems to register for courses (SSOL, Vergil, Columbia directory of classes) "
36,425,Stop using DUO
37,454,I don't know of any way to get a quick unencrypted unofficial transcript. 
38,457,"The user interface is terrible and seems like a website from the 90â€™s. Furthermore, there seems to be a lack of coordination between different departments of Columbia. For example, course information (schedule, descriptions, exams) seems to be inaccurate on SSOL for a variety of Business School courses. Overall, very disappointed. "
39,465,good app
40,479,"I think the SSOL design can definitely use an update. The user-interface is extremely bad, making the experience unncessarily taxing and laborious. Hire some UI/UX designers please!! "
41,503,The course registration should be more fair
42,524,Doesn't show the ranking in waitlist
43,546,Billing is confusing to understand.
44,572,Course registration was not a very smooth process.
45,580,"Coming straight out of undergrad, I found this system much more unintuitive than the system my previous University used. Especially with course enrollment, there are so many websites to keep track of and we are responsible for learning how to use the multiple websites. I believe that the usage of only website for course enrollment is more efficient. For example, in my previous University, our SSOL equivalent website had an enrollment tab where we searched for all our classes, clicked on one class to see its description, waitlist/enrollment status and could add it to our shopping cart which existed in the same enrollment tab. Everything was in one area which is much easier to use.    Although not completely related to SSOL, I would like to add that I wish that the list of courses satisfying the tracks reflected better on how often those courses are offered because in the Vision and Graphics Track, a lot of the interesting classes listed have not been offered for a while."
46,583,Registration should open at the same time for all students within a department. It not be in different slots within the day.
47,594,The accounts and billing page is not helpful at all and very difficult to understand. Overall the system is very outdated and in desperate need of an update 
48,600,CBS and SSOL are separate systems. Should integrate
49,601,Make us aware of the features
50,604,"The system looks so old and like it was developed in the early 2000's. It needs to be completely revamped. Also, course planning/waitlist/scheduling should all be able to use 24/7. I think it is ridiculous that you can only add a class during random times of the day and the server is otherwise just not working."
51,606,The user interface is quite a bit obsolete.
52,622,It would be helpful if we can see our current position in the waitlist
53,653,-
54,660,"Most of my issues are with a lack of CS course planning causing massive waitlists than with SSOL issues for registration, but SSOL's UX/UI is certainly a pain and could use a refresh"
55,671,Flex has been malfunctioning for a few weeks and I am graduating (need to use all). 
56,724,The user interface has gotten better but still needs a lot of work
57,730,"The billing information is sometimes wrong, especially for the date the rent is posted."
58,737,Vergil is great!
59,741,It should display your current position on the waitlist rather than displaying the total number of students on the waitlist
60,754,no  
61,756,I really wish there were more detailed and accurate course descriptions so it would be easier to choose what courses to take
62,758,"I don't use SSOL often, except to register for classes and pay bills on my account. "
63,769,"I'd appreciate it if the registration appointments for the entire department were opened at the same time if the idea is to offer courses on a first-come, first-serve basis. One program's having registration appointments earlier than the other creates bias, and the program's having later appointment times doesn't get the opportunity to enrol for the courses they want since the good courses have already reached the waitlist. The same happened with MSE, as registration opened at 5 PM for MSE, while MSOR and MSIE had earlier registration start times."
64,770,The website is great to use but a friendlier UX would have been better. Currently it looks a little intimidating with lot of functionalities and forms.
65,771,Waitlist is not in a first come-first server base
66,788,No additional comments
67,801,UI can be improved 
68,803,It's great
69,812,"Course registration and wailtlist features are hard to use. You never know whether you will be entered for ""instruction management"""
70,816,Why do we need registration appointments after the initial opening of registration?
71,842,"Should also show the criteria and information about degree awards, so that students are informed. "
72,849,"If not all courses need to be waited in waitlist, it would be better for us to select courses."
73,856,"Vergil is a pain in the ass to use - the layout is trash, the course descriptions/syllabi are rarely there, there shouldn't have to be a separate website from SSOL"
74,858,"What a terrible system for class registration. As someone who attended a public school for undergrad, the difference in class registration procedure is frankly embarrassing. Aside from the severely restricted class sizes that make it difficult to get into desired classes, I also somehow enrolled for a few courses that ended up having no bearing on my course requirements, when this should have been clearly communicated automatically through the system. Setting up this kind of a automated system/filter would be extremely easy, and shows the lack of care about Columbia students. The fact that Hybrid sections are closed to students is also ludicrous. "
75,860,It would be better if I can see my rank on the waitlist. 
76,862,Registration isnâ€™t intuitive 
77,868,naur
78,889,DNE
79,925,"The registration process needs to be overhauled. Other much larger institutions are able to handle mass student registrations, without requiring registration appointments. Columbia should look for a registration solution that does not require registration appointments. Also, it is not feasible to have 3 academic advisors manually put students into courses. Students should be able to be automatically added to courses based on predetermined, automatic, priority and to be added by an automated computer system. Currently, the 3 academic advisors are not able to handle manually adding thousands of students to courses. An automated solution will fix 99% of the major issues with course registration now. The current system is a major issue, leading to undue student and faculty stress as students cannot finalize their schedule until the last day of the course change period. An automated system that can be modified if needed by the 3 person student advising team would fix problem completely."
80,932,"Accounts and billing crashes frequently, where I would be able to access my balance and then 15 minutes later I would be completely unable to reload the page for hours.  The wish list/wait list system is unintuitive and frustrating. Vergil also has a very inconvenient integration with SSOL"
81,954,would be nice if entry requirements for all courses were nicely laid out. 
82,955,The hold was not removed in time
83,962,Would love an easier way to get a free unofficial transcript.
84,964,"Pretty easy to use, but it would be better if the employment site were integrated into it so that it became a truly one-stop-shop for all affiliate needs. "
85,970,The degree requirements seems too stringent.
86,981,Billing is vague for graduate students. I often do not know what I am being charged for and have to email my department administrator.
87,1000,"Allowing registration only at certain times during the day is a really big problem. Registration should be allowed for an entire period, it doesnâ€™t make sense that it is during fixed time slots in the day."
88,1007,"Vergil does not upload all course evaluations. Particularly, I have noticed that negative evaluations seem to not appear for certain classes."
89,1020,"The deadline for fee payment is always fixed which doesn't make sense at times. E.g: The deadline for payment is Jan 25th. Let's say I get registered for a course only on Jan 24th, the balance gets reflected on SSOL a day late and has to be payed immediately.    It would be convenient to have my current waitlist number reflected during registration, rather than just the whole waitlist size."
90,1022,They updated the interface and it still looks like dogshit from the 90's
91,1027,"The list of courses enrolled in should be frequently updated especially when it's closer to tuition payment deadlines. I dropped classes before the drop deadline and it took a while for the system to be updated, which caused unnecessary worry/stress because the tuition payment due was much higher than it should be and courses were still not updated the day of the tuition payment deadline. "
92,1045,SSOL is a great platform to find about billing details.
93,1047,"The accounts and billing is not transparent and broken. Especially if you are renting through Columbia. There will be huge unassigned fees randomly showing up in your account for no reason and with no explanation. Then students are expected to wait until billing corrects things half way through the semester to represent your rent bills. But even then it's hard to know what you should actually be paying, when, and where it came from."
94,1050,COMS4232 is completely trash. They hired a TA who cant even understand basic maths.
95,1068,"During my time at Columbia, course registration has always been a mess. Waitlists are never clear as to the selection process, and ending with the classes you want/need is close to impossible. There are so many matching methods (we study some of them in CS Network classes!), why don't we use them?"
96,1080,want a separate course registration system
97,1083,Maybe redesign the user interface or include a mobile application?
98,1085,My degree audit has shown an error the entire time I've been enrolled.
99,1087,"It is confusing to me how the account balance, payment plan, and financial aid are all at different places and not consolidated together for Student Financial Services.    It is also confusing for me to have Vergil and Course Registration at different places, and they sometimes offer different information."
100,1093,It could have a more colorful UI
101,1096,UI could be better.
102,1108,"the overview, its very old"
103,1112,fee/tuition of CVN or hybrid courses should not be the same as a regular on-campus course
104,1121,The billing could be refreshed every hour instead of just once per day.  Waiting lists should be opened one day before the last day of registration.
105,1122,Some stipend and refund transection record was not updated simultaneously on SSOL.
106,1125,I wish it can be connected with the CBS coursematch platform more seamlessly & transparently.
107,1133,"SSOL gets the job done, despite it's age"
108,1141,"The course registration process is a mess, there should be a better system in place than first-come, first-serve.  Additionally having separate registration systems with the Business School is also a hassle.  The entire school should adopt one system."
109,1146,I found the website to be very difficult to navigate. The user interface is neither intuitive nor modern.
110,1148,"I don't understand why students can only register for classes during the day, which can be quite inconvenient for students living in other countries during the registration. "
111,1155,It sometimes work slow during the registration period
112,1161,My first name has more than 15 characters and SSOL cannot accommodate more than 15 characters because of which my first name had to be split into first and middle even-though it's inaccurate 
113,1166,N/a
114,1173,"SSOL is dated and visually displeasing. Itâ€™s a runaround to find out what needs to be done, and even the most basic features feel like Iâ€™m booting up my windows 95 desktop from my childhood. "
115,1177, The time for requesting transcript is very long. over half month for me and no response.
116,1191,The course registration and vergil course planning are not easy to use. My undergraduate institution had a single interface that did both of these tasks and it was much more intuitive and easy to use/navigate and changes were also instant (i.e. did not have to wait for it to update overnight).
117,1201,SSOL is very nice
118,1206,waitlist can sometimes be too long
119,1210,No timetable to show schedule clearly in ssol
120,1221,I would like to see the ranking on the waitlist and the current enrollment of a course after I joined the waitlist.
121,1228,Simple and good. 
122,1232,"Vergil is a little glitchy sometimes and won't let me add things to my schedule directly, instead making me add it to my wishlist and then add to my schedule. Not sure why that is. I also wish I could see how many people are still registered for a course after I sign up for it myself; usually that info seems to go away once I'm in and sometimes I might want to know. "
123,1235,registration interface and vergil suck
124,1237,"SSOL is an extremely outdated system, and it is ridiculous that logging in 1 sec late causes me to be at position 100 in the waitlist for many of my desired courses. Using a system similar to coursematch, would be preferable"
125,1247,"It is inconvenient that there are multiple places to get classes and not officially register for them, like want list, wish list, on Vergil, it's very clunky to work through."
126,1254,"SSOL is terrible and outdated. Seeing ""Instructor Managed"" on every CS waitlist offers no information as to whether a student may get admitted to a course, it goes down during most major registration periods, and putting in formal and slow requests even to just send yourself an online transcript is very tedious.    Also, while I agree for the next question, I think the main solution should be opening more sections of courses and increasing teaching staff, rather than presenting online courses as the only solution to the over-enrollment problem here"
127,1267,might also add link to meal plan
128,1286,Please allow course registration at all times of day rather than only specific hours.
129,1287,It is difficult to find tax forms.
130,1298,123
131,1304,Accounts and billing should be clearer in listing our credits & balances. 
132,1307,Cannot be able to see how many meals left in my dinning plan.
133,1333,it could be more easier to use on billing part
134,1339,SSOL could be a little bit more transparent with the waitlists.
135,1347,"Billing is very difficult to understand on SSOL. The credits and charges have names that are difficult to understand. Also after several years of getting direct deposits, I started receiving my stipend checks in the mail, which is very unsafe, and I didn't know that I had to re-verify my routing information because I never received an email."
136,1356,Digital Transcript takes up to 24 hours to email. It's not convenient especially when submitting job applications on a deadline.  
137,1358,"After being added to waitlist, it doesn't show your current waitlist status "
138,1359,I would really like to know my place on the waitlist
139,1360,Most are perfect 
140,1361,Lack of unofficial transcript printable version.
141,1363,"I would like to see the course planning and signup system integrated, with the ability to see prospective schedules on a weekly calendar. The course search and registration aspects of SSOL are not convenient or user friendly"
142,1364,"It's way too complicated for international students to pay! using Western Union costs 1000$, this is not normal "
143,1368,Billing deadline is not super clear. Should give more reminders before late fee is applied.
144,1369,It would be helpful to have the late dropping function activated online. 
145,1373,"When selecting classes, the credit limitation and registration time is not convenient "
146,1376,Why transcripts request is not free?
147,1403,Great work on the SSOL console.
148,1413,Freezes a lot during course registration process.
149,1430,I wanted to drop a course at some point but was having a really tough time accomplishing this task? It sounds a bit dumb but it seemed like it was virtually impossible to drop a course before midterms. 
150,1433,It doesn't make sense to have to request an online version of an unofficial copy of the transcript. You could just have a download PDF of a clearly unofficial document (watermark it) on the transcript page which is how most universities in Canada do it!
151,1436,Information on Vergil is inaccurate
152,1445,Academic certification requests are very slow
153,1450,Registration closures during nighttime hours can be frustrating.
154,1457,/
155,1465,Very annoying that registration is only within certain time intervals. Doesn't make any sense to me. Why does it matter if I sign up for a course at 8 am rather than 9 am?
156,1471,The site isn't capable of handling the load during the first day of registration when a student wants to join multiple waitlists
157,1495,"What a dreadful set of tools... Course scheduling is always a nightmare of disorganization, and all of the tools seem disconnected. I should not need four different tabs open to determine my valid electives..."
158,1505,Very outdated 
159,1507,Why can't we register at any time of day after a certain date like how other universities do?
160,1510,"Columbia really needs to modernize Vergil/Course Catalog/SSOL. Current UI is terrible. Also, we need to have one platform to register instead of finding courses on the course catalog, adding them to Vergil, and pushing them to SSOL."
161,1517,SSOL must be redesigned. A total disaster of a website. Smells like 90s.
162,1533,Really needs an update: no reason for there to be registration periods
163,1540,Canvas' schedule more useful and accessible than SSOL's
164,1549,"it's a bargain bin solution, and it shows. (doesn't the universty have money for things other than the lawn?)   the oracle software is really dreadful to use, with confusing menus and hard to find features.   The multiple, mixed systems stapled together really doesn't help. (billing vs ssol etc)   Waitlist is almost worthless - I couldn't join a waitlist because it would put me over my credit limit, BUT if I wanted to drop a class and join the waitlist, there was no guarantee I'd be fulltime.  Really needs to be better.     And what's with the weird downtimes? does registration really need so many disparate windows?     Anyway. I know this will never change in the slightest, but the system is pretty much garbage. "
