When I tried getting an appointment with Columbia Mental Health Services in the middle of the Fall 2018 semester, they were read to refer me to an outside therapist. That was not convenient for me.     The reasoning was they did not consider me at-risk, so could not find someone I'd be able to see until the end of that semester. That was very discouraging for me, and it felt that, just like everything else at Columbia, even counseling is a competition and a numbers game.

All I receive is a floor plan of my room. I had no other choice than accepting the offer since otherwise, I would have to reapply and wait uncertain amount of time for another housing assignment. When I moved into the place, I did not like my apartment yet I had no option other than staying. After a few weeks, I realized that the old furnitures at my apartment had bed bugs which create a huge problem for me in the middle of an already rough first semester. If only students who are offered an housing assignment were allowed to view their spaces before moving in, they would be able to make a better decision. UAH has to really step up their game in making this a smooth process. Like any off-campus housing (OCHA) offers provide you with pictures of the living space and furnitures as well as a time for the visit. The Columbia Residential application should include them when they give an assignment to the student.

We use the BME conference room when it's available but it usually isn't during the day.  Additionally, my biggest source of frustration with this school is the lack of info provided at orientation and the administration's willingness to help.  Any resource I've uncovered I've had to figure out by myself (e.g. obtaining financial aid, gym memberships, finding places to eat on campus, finding places to study).  Additionally, out of the 8 classes I've taken, only 2 of my professors care about me as a person.  The rest are unwilling to help me understand the material, which is unacceptable given how much we pay to attend."

So I ranked dorm before apartment for that reason.  However, when I got an assignment, I got a dorm that was $1250 a month.  If I knew I would be paying that much for a dorm, I would have just ranked apartment first since it's the same price.  The transfer process was difficult at first because after filling out the transfer application in November, they had told me that I might be able to move in April/May 2019.  I didn't want to wait that long, but I didn't have a choice. Thankfully, I got a notice that my dorm was going to undergo construction in May 2019, so everyone needed to move out.  Hence, my transfer application was bumped up, and I have officially transferred as of March 2019.  It would be nice to be given floor plans of the apartments during the transfer process or be able to see units as if one was apartment hunting prior to ranking units in the Selection Rounds.  Otherwise, Columbia Residential was very helpful during the transfer process.",Strongly agree,Neither agree nor disagree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,,,,,,Not Applicable,,I did not use their service,,,Department source,,,,,,4,Yes,Strongly disagree,76% - 100%,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,No,,,,,,,,,I did not serve as a TA,,,,,,No,Yes,Not Applicable,,,,,Female,,,,,,No,,Egyptian-American,,,21-23,Yes,Yes,
