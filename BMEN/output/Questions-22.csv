Once I asked someone in the career office what kind of salary I should expect to make after graduating and they only knew numbers for masters. This is the kind of information that is extremely important for us to know as we graduate. I think many PhD students are used to making very little and so are willing to take jobs far below what they should be valued at simply because the salary is higher than a student salary, when in fact they are the most (or some of the most) qualified candidates coming in.

These companies recruit directly at universities of lower caliber, and should have a strong presence on our campus as well. Additionally, career events should not be restricted to students.

Frankly, some of the company/role postings are insulting for a graduate of Columbia.    It’s not just about the number of students placed into internships and jobs, but also the quality of those placements. How happy the students are with the role they ended up getting, and if they achieved their goals when it comes to the types of companies and types of roles they wanted. In my humble opinion, CPOs should be incentivized based on the quality of career placements/student satisfaction with their placements, not just the fact that a student “got a job/internship”.     It’s obvious- Columbia ranks higher than my undergrad program, but my Columbia program’s alumni end up working, on average, at worse firms than my undergrad peers. Why is this? We students feel that we are left to fend for ourselves to get the good opportunities we actually want, because the opportunities on VMock and as facilitated by individual CPOs are lacking, a portion of them frankly scraping the bottom of the barrel.     Employer expos and company-specific info sessions, and especially talks with alumni about their careers and companies, have been helpful, though.

There is disability discrimination when asking faculty advisors for reasonable accommodation for non visible disabilities, such as depression or ptsd. Harassment and threats from other students is also well tolerated by students when the offending student is a PhD student; why are threats normalized and tolerated and more so why is the blame shifted on the victim for “not being a team player” or that the faculty advisor is “disappointed that you are not being more understanding of [the threatening student’s] stress.” The onus should not be on the receiver of threats and harassment for minimizing threats and harassment received, especially when related to race, gender/sex, physical appearance, disability status, etc. You need an hr department for dealing with faculty supervisors.

On top of this, reaching out to an advisor for other ways that I could complete the requirements and the only suggestion was to either work it out with every individual professor or switch to a completely online program is not a valuable answer. Every full time employee/part time student I know share the same sentiment. Specially with the courses available, it feels like we are less than second thought.

It should not be necessary for students to do this over email in the first place, but I have heard countless anecdotes of students having to repeatedly email the departmental staff just to get a single response. Moreover, there should never be any situation where an academic staff member is allowed to remove a student from a course without their permission, particularly in cases where the academic staff members completely ignore emails regarding registration in the first place. Next, it is confusing as to why comp exams are never announced prior to the start of a semester.

Most of the individuals that I have interacted with in the department are absolutely lovely and incredibly helpful, but the individual I have in mind is rude, unempathetic and accusatory every single time we interact. This is unfortunate because the individual has a lot of responsibilities. I’m also unsure if the department is aware, but most of the phone lines listed on the Computer Science department website are unanswered. This is the case even for the CRF hotline. There is also not enough transparency between lab members and CUIT/Facilities. There is currently not a listserv to directly contact all affiliates who use a particular resource (e.g., a server), which is necessary when that resource needs to go through maintenance. Upon requesting one, they claimed that all necessary information is conveyed to “lab managers” but this is not a position that exists, and assumes that there is clear communication between such “lab managers” and lab members to begin with.

Currently we need to take a written exam covering 8 courses in 2 days in May, and a 90 minutes oral exam regarding all the 8 courses in next February, if we had passed the written exam. This means we need to spend the first 2 years of phd doing nothing but preparing for the exams. This exam is specially harsh and harming my mental health. I need to study for 12 hours a day, seven days a week just for the written exams, as it covers a big range of material. I pursue phd degree in pursuit of knowledge, not the deterioration of my mental health. I think if the department wants us to acquire the knowledge, they could just look at the GPa for the courses, instead of compress everything into a 2 days 8 hours written exam.': 1, 'More awareness around resources available to students.': 1, 'I work uptown at the medical campus in a building occupied by many engineering labs.

While my experience at Columbia has definitely been exceptional, please find below additional feedback that I considered important to express: First, there are no scholarships or sources of funding provided for MS Students in the IEOR Department. This is something that definitely should be considered as undertaking a graduate education is a serious investment and is often a deal-breaker for many students. Many other departments in Columbia Engineering consist of some funding initiative for incoming students, and especially considering that IEOR is the biggest department within Columbia Engineering. Second, please discuss and consider the option of allowing a four semester option, instead of three semesters, of completion time for 36 point degree programs such as MSMSE and MSBA. The curriculum is very, very packed, more often than not not allowing for a proper career/job search and getting involved in opportunities outside of classes, not to mention that students who are facing difficult personal circumstances such as financial hardships, conflicts in their home countries, or the illness/death of a relative would definitely benefit from a world-class education in a less intense environment. From personal experience as I myself have experienced one of these issues during my time at Columbia, a ""virtual support space"" or being referred to counseling isn\'t nearly as effective as having a more balanced lifestyle in order to pay proper attention to physical, mental, and emotional well-being. This would allow students who wish to complete their degree programs in three semesters to do so, while providing students a four-semester completion option should they decide that is the right option for them. Similarly, it would be good to bring to the attention of IEOR the discrepancies in registration between IEOR and CBS - some programs are advertised as being offered jointly with CBS; however, elective selection is very reduced for students in these programs who do not get similar priority to MBA students in choosing courses, and students in these programs may be left registering for what\'s left over after the MBAs complete their registration, not being able to properly align their education to their desired career path. Finally, it would be good to consider implementing more practical applications in coursework. While theory might be essential to understanding the fundamentals, it is not as useful to students in degree programs that would typically lead to a position in industry, as opposed to a position in academia.

While Columbia claims to pay among the highest wages in the US, when adjusted for the cost of living in NYC and considering the fact that many graduate students may enter school with massive student loans, many students may leave graduate school in a worse financial situation than when they started. The University often does not address this. Additionally, funding could be communicated more effectively. Students on stipend often do not know how much they will be paid each semester, or what date the payment will be administered. The university may also alleviate financial stress by reminding studends on stipend that they will have to learn how to pay quarterly estimated taxes on their stipends to avoid fees, as many first year fellowship students are unaware of this. Overall, the University could offer improved financial services: in stipend/yearly payroll amounts, communication of payment timelines/amounts, and counseling/educational services provided.': 1, 'Good job not mentioning the union once!
