There are labs at CUIMC that contain engineering students just by putting more events at end of the day they would be more accessible. Also sometimes communication seems targeted at people who are actively on campus. For example the Cooking with Judy Joo thing. I signed up but never was told when to come to pick up the meal kit.

I really do not understand why PDL sessions are not offered at NIGHT. 7pm and later all students are available. So far all PDL sessions have been exclusively offered during times when I have class. Then I get condescending emails from the PDL team to ""make sure to mark my calendar"" so I don't miss a session. Marking my calendar was never the problem. These sessions should be offered at night so they are available to all students. Especially if you make them required and they are 2 hours long! But also, some of these sessions cater to certain students than others. I should not have to go to a consulting PDL session, potentially taking someone else's spot, because I feel that this is the only one that works with my schedule and I need to fill a quota, rather than going because I am genuinely interested and want to pursue consulting. This has happened to me for a rare interviewing PDL session I wanted to attend, but instead people who just wanted to get their credits filled took most of the spots. If this program is truly supplementing our professional development, then it should be catered to the students not the PDL staff.

What I did not expect was for there to only be a couple of courses offered outside of business hours every semester. Not only narrowing my choices to expand my horizons but forcing me to follow a path of courses simply because they are the only ones available to me. In addition, making a required course for one hour in the middle of the day made for a very uncomfortable conversation during later interview stages as being upfront with scheduling conflicts is essential for transparency. On top of this, reaching out to an advisor for other ways that I could complete the requirements and the only suggestion was to either work it out with every individual professor or switch to a completely online program is not a valuable answer. Every full time employee/part time student I know share the same sentiment. Specially with the courses available, it feels like we are less than second thought. It is already difficult enough for us to try our hardest to have social lives and make meaningful connections with our peers while they are capable of being on campus and working together in person all day while we have responsibilities to our employers, but then to feel like academics is also unwavering. I understand this is a very difficult situation for both parties. It isn't like a professor would like to teach a class from 6-9pm. But it is also difficult to feel like Columbia is saying amazing, congrats on your admittance. Oh, you have a job, well good luck trying to find valuable and diverse course options. Professors have been amazing and responsive and for that I am very grateful. I just wish a plan could be made to better assist those with other conflicts that deserve a high quality education nonetheless.",Biomedical Engineering,Master of Science (M.S.)

There is disability discrimination when asking faculty advisors for reasonable accommodation for non visible disabilities, such as depression or ptsd. Harassment and threats from other students is also well tolerated by students when the offending student is a PhD student; why are threats normalized and tolerated and more so why is the blame shifted on the victim for “not being a team player” or that the faculty advisor is “disappointed that you are not being more understanding of [the threatening student’s] stress.” The onus should not be on the receiver of threats and harassment for minimizing threats and harassment received, especially when related to race, gender/sex, physical appearance, disability status, etc. You need an hr department for dealing with faculty supervisors.
