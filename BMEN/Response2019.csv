So I ranked dorm before apartment for that reason.  However, when I got an assignment, I got a dorm that was $1250 a month.  If I knew I would be paying that much for a dorm, I would have just ranked apartment first since it's the same price.  The transfer process was difficult at first because after filling out the transfer application in November, they had told me that I might be able to move in April/May 2019.  I didn't want to wait that long, but I didn't have a choice. Thankfully, I got a notice that my dorm was going to undergo construction in May 2019, so everyone needed to move out.  Hence, my transfer application was bumped up, and I have officially transferred as of March 2019.  It would be nice to be given floor plans of the apartments during the transfer process or be able to see units as if one was apartment hunting prior to ranking units in the Selection Rounds.  Otherwise, Columbia Residential was very helpful during the transfer process.",5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,,,,,,Not Applicable,,I did not use their service,,,Department source,,,,,,4,Yes,1,76% - 100%,5,5,5,No,,,,,,,,,I did not serve as a TA,,,,,,No,Yes,Not Applicable,,,,,Female,,,,,,No,,Egyptian-American,,,21-23,Yes,Yes,,Biomedical Engineering,M.S. leading to Ph.D.
